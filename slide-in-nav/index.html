        In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed
        by humans as food as part of a meal. The term vegetable is somewhat
        arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.
        It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits,
        nuts, and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses. The original
        meaning of the word vegetable, still used in biology, was to describe
        all types of plant, as in the terms "vegetable kingdom" and "vegetable
        matter".

        Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers
        and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during
        the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life
        developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been
        cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from
        elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown
        all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in
        protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest
        producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows
        consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale
        of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of
        their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of
        single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned,
        harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and
        marketing.

        Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role
        in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high
        in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage
        people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions
        a day often being recommended.
